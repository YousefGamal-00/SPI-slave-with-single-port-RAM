# SPI Slave with Single-Port RAM - FPGA Implementation

## Overview
This project implements an SPI slave with single-port RAM on an FPGA. It includes RTL code, testbenches, and synthesis results.


## Features
**-SPI Slave Interface**: Handles communication from a master device, supporting full-duplex data transfer.
**-Single-Port RAM:** Provides storage for data received via SPI, with configurable depth and width.
**-Integrated Design:** A top-level wrapper integrates the SPI slave and RAM, ensuring efficient data handling.
**-Testbench Included:** Simulate the design to verify functionality before FPGA implementation.


##Tools
**Modelsim**

**Xilinx Vivado**
